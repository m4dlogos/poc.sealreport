Unblock files
=============

If you cannot view the Help.chm or you get errors when running or building the demo applications then this might be an indication that the files 
were blocked by Windows and you have to unblock them as described below.

Before extracting the downloaded Zip archive it is recommended to unblock the Zip file in case it was blocked by Windows OS and marked 
as an Internet download. To unblock the file, right click the Zip file in Windows Explorer, choose the 'Properties' menu item from contextual 
menu and enable the Unblock option if this option is displayed in file properties. As an alternative, you can also unblock the extracted binary, 
documentation and other files (the .dll, .chm, .resx files) individually following the same procedure described for the Zip file.

If you extracted the archive without unblocking the Zip file first, you can still unblock the blocked files (the .dll, .dat, .chm, .resx files) 
individually following the same procedure described for the Zip file.

Uninstallation
==============
